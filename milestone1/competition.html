        <h4>What are they doing right?</h4>
        <p>
            Many of my competetors include links to their resumes in their websites and many of them have stylized color schemes and layouts.
            <br>All of them include some background about them and their positive qualities.
        </p>
        
        <h4>What are they doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>
            They fail to include <i>all</i> of these atributes in their websites.
            <br>Thats something I'm going to fix in mine.
